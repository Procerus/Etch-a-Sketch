# Etch-a-Sketch

## Function:
Written in JavaScript the program has an area on the screen that when the user moves their mouse over causes those parts to change color. The program uses the JS Dom feature to change the backround color based on a mouse over event. You can press a button to reset the screen and it will prompt for a number of blocks the user wants. There is also another color option that makes the blocks get slightly darker after every event and eventually causing them to go black.
